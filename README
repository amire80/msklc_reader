This is a program that reads MSKLC files, also known as
Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator and MS KLC.

It is based on Portable Keyboard Layout code by Farkas Máté:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pkl/
Modifications by Amir E. Aharoni (amir.aharoni@mail.huji.ac.il).

The version here doesn't add any new functionality - it only fixes a couple
of minor bugs and does the same thing:
* parse a KLC file
* output a matching PKL ini file.

The plan is to make it into a generic KLC parser than can output various
formats, such as XKB, Keyman, Narayam etc.
